- ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Iâ€™m @GGgRain, and I'm UE4 gameplay and plugin developer.

- Iâ€™m mostly interested in creating some games that use unique technologies(simply, codes and plugins) that I created by myself.
Even though there is a replacement for my system, I enjoy making it on my on.

- Iâ€™m currently learning UE4's various features and editor extensions to make my plugins work more neat and clearly and expectedly.

- My commits may be not frequent and may commits a lot of things at once. I only commit something when I think it is ready to go. Before that stage, all the codes are stored in my private storage.
And also almost everything I commit will be on my private repos, so you might don't know what I am doing.

- SimpleDialogueSystem is one of my works!

- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Epic games.

- You can reach me with: devgrain13@gmail.com
